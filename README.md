# Advent of Code 2022
This repository contains my solutions for the [2022 Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022). 

I decided to do this year's challneges in Rust as I am in the process of learning it :)

The repository is a single cargo workspace with the solution for each day in it's own sub-package.

## To build:

`cargo build` to build everything 

  or 
  
`cargo build --package aoc-day#` to build the solution for a given day.

## To run:

`cargo run --package aoc-day#` to run the solution for a given day
